    This testWrite.py file is a testcase for python-nonblock (c) 2015,2016,2017 Tim Savannah.

    The testcase itself is hereby granted access as a Public Domain work, or the closest legally in your area.

    This tests the various priority levels of BackgroundWrite and gives output based on results.

    You can use this to experiment with different values and priority levels on your hardware and use cases.

    It will perform some math/memory operations whilst writing 2 files using chains at the same time.
    The result will give how long it took to write, how many calculations could be performed in that time, and an
    "interactivity score". The interactivity score is the number of calculations divided by the time you spent writing.
    The higher the ioPrio, the higher the interactivity score should be. It is a measure of how much OTHER work got done while you were
    performing otherwise blocking I/O operations.

    You may consider having a "normal" background workload going before running this test, so you can guage for yourself
      what interactivity level to choose with BackgroundWrite depending on if you want to maximize throughput of your write,
      or cpu-bound / other processes.

    There is a "DO_SYNC" option, that if True will cause the drive to flush all data to disk. You may want to play with this on
    and off. For example, if you are running a dd if=/dev/urandom of=testfile bs=512 to simulate background I/O on the same device,
    it will flush both datasets. This is moreso intended to be set to True when NO background I/O is going.
